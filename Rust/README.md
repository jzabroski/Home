Microsoft is adopting Rust with Project Verona.

They have tried porting some of their C and C++ code to Rust.  Microsoft engineer Adam Burch, from the Hyper-V team, was tasked with re-writing some low-level code in Rust.

> However, not all things went smoothly. It would have been unrealistic if we expected they would. Burch cited the lack of safe transmutation, safe support for C style unions, fallible allocation, and a lack of support for at-scale unit testing, needed for Microsoft's sprawling code-testing infrastructure.

> "I'm confident that we at Microsoft will be able to help in these endeavors to shape the future of the language to improve its usefulness in these scenarios," Burch said.
> 
> The Microsoft engineer said he sees a bright future for Rust in microcontrollers and low-level systems like kernels and hypervisors, where the language's security-first features will make it quite attractive once it matures.
