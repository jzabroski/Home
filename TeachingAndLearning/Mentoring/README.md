McKinsey 2000 study, The War for Talent, appears to be seminal research and what has driven modern advisor-advisee.
Three researchers from the Center for Creative Leadership in a study done two decades ago, that’s been replicated many many times over, they interviewed over 200 executives in a report called Key Events in Executives’ Lives. And in this report, they found that of the 200 top-level executives who were the top of their game, all of them had similar characteristics, and one of them was that early on in their career they have been thrust into a leadership role that required them to make decisions that had serious consequences. They also had a mentor in place that helped them appreciate the lessons they were supposed to learn from those experiences. The study created a leadership framework that basically said in essence that someone with potential, if given the opportunity to engage in strategically relevant experiences and given the ability to learn the lessons from those experiences, would have a higher likelihood of success in their career in a leadership capacity.
