# Accounts
Accounts are associated with particular customers, and traders are assigned to trade particular accounts.

See CAST Set Up Workflow

Once you have created a new individual, group, or omnibus account, you use the Accounts pages to establish and maintain:

* risk settings
* risk parameters
* account authorization
* market limits
* balances

You can also view, modify, remove, and restore accounts.
