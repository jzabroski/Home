All iron lofts have been sneaking up for the past 20 years, it's why every other year all of the manufacturers are touting "more distance" vs your current set. Lofts for a long time were 28° on a 5 iron and 48° on a wedge. Think 845/Ping Eye 2 era. Prior to that they were 1-2° weaker still. Most sets now may allow you to reach for 9 iron on that Par 3, but really you are hitting an 8 or even 7.5 with "9" on the bottom. Good for egos and sales. Problem is now you need 4-5 "wedges" because of the lofts. It's all just marketing and ego stroking. No more 3/4 irons, throw a hybrid and an extra wedge, it's all the same game (distance wise) just with a different stamp in the bottom.
