OpenRefine is a data cleaning project that is written in Java, and uses MIT's simile-butterly web framework as the front-end.

This page will serve as a design document for my decisions.

# TODO List

1. Write StarUML Interaction diagram, similar to the startProject/openProject/obtainLock/addTransformations/releaseLock/getState/expire life-cycle
