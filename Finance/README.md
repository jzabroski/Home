## Loan Terminology
1. A *conforming loan* is any loan amount of $417,000 or less.
2. A *jumbo loan* is any loan greater than $417,000. Generally speaking, jumbo loans will have slightly higher interest rates than a conforming loan.
3. On January 1, 2009 the "*super conforming*" or "*agency jumbo*" loan was created for loan amounts up to $729,750.
4. *YSP* means [yield spread premium](https://www.thetruthaboutmortgage.com/mortgage-dictionary/yield-spread-premium/).
5. *BACKEND RATIO*
    > Also known as a debt-to-income ratio which is your total monthly obligations (debt) divided by your gross monthly income. Your monthly obligations include such items as your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance premiums, installment loans, and revolving debt (credit cards). This ratio is used to determine your capacity to repay the mortgage and all other debts. Your debt-to-income ratio is a crucial calculation in determining the loan amount for which you can qualify.
6. *PITI*
    > *P*rincipal, *I*nterest, *T*axes and *I*nsurance. The Principal and Interest can be either fixed for the term of the loan or changed at specific intervals in accordance with the terms of the loan program. The Taxes and Insurance portion may be adjusted to reflect changes in taxes and/or insurance costs.
7. PITI RATIO*
    > Compares the amount of the monthly income to the amount the borrower will owe each month in principal, interest, real estate tax and insurance on a mortgage. Lenders use it in deciding whether to give the borrower a loan. (Compare to Qualifying Income Ratio.)


The broker charges a broker origination fee that is paid to the broker per loan transaction from the lender (assuming lender paid compensation).  The broker origination fee is paid to the broker.  The broker then pays the MLO (whatever compensation plan that is set with). Unless he/she is a producing broker, most broker's make their money on the volume of their MLO's, for obviously taking on the compliance of being the broker, and hopefully helping when needed, etc.

4. *CRA area* refers to Community Reinvestment Act area covered by a local bank.  The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a law intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations.

## CarFax vs. AutoCheck vs VinAudit

1. https://blog.drivetime.com/carfax-vs-autocheck-3-differences-must-know/ (Dec 15, 2013)
    > The most significant difference between AutoCheck and CarFax is that AutoCheck is far better at tracking auction cars, while CarFax is known for not being able to effectively track cars at auctions. This obstacle makes CarFax much less useful since many used cars have been auctioned off at some point in their history. 
2. VinAudit has a bulk audit api

## Car Buying

### Sites
- www.cargurus.com
  - Advertises on SeekingAlpha, and many sports news sites and vBulletin sports discussion boards.
- www.autotrader.com
  - Excellent for Carvana cars
- www.dealerrater.com
- fakereviews.com
  - Check if a review is fake or not
- https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls
  - Gives not only recall information, but complaint info that is used as the basis for complaints.

### Data
- https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=33288

### Principles
- Understand the different between a "salvage title" and a "rebuilt title" or "reconstructed title".
    - Do not buy a car with a salvage title.
    - Do not buy a rebuilt/reconstructed car for more than 80% of it's bottom tier KBB value.
    - If the car has been in an accident, look for any frame rail damage, since frame damage can cause tires to wear unevenly, among other things.
- Check tread depth. New tires can easily cost $800 or more.
- Don't buy a 4 cylinder Turbo charged engine. All it will do is put extra pressure on the engine, and extra pressure means increased maintenance costs due to wear and tear. 
- Cars at 60,000 miles tend to require a lot of maintenance.  YourMechanic.com mobile site has good visual plot of maintenance over time.
- Never buy a BMW v8.  Known issues going back to 2004 that they have never fixed.  People who buy BMW v8 have money to do so brand new, and then afte the 4 year, 50k mile warranty, they dump it on whoever comes next.  Don't be that person that gets dumped on.
- If you're not good at keeping up on scheduled maintenance, don't buy an [interference engine](https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-interference-engines-are-and-why-they-exist-1823935549)

### Inspection
- Must be done within 7 days of purchase, not 7 days of registration. Watch out for dealers that play tricks with the date you purchase VS. Date you take possession. 
- SEMASAN has detailed emissions laws by state https://www.semasan.com/resources/vehicle-emissions-inspection-requirements-and-exemptions-state

### Title 
- Never buy a car with history in Mississippi. After 1 year as a rebuilt title the car is eligible for a clean title. All those cars from flooding of the Mississippi River with flood damage? Yup. Bought at auction, held for a year, and sold with a clean title 

# Tinting Laws
- https://www.tinting-laws.com/massachusetts/

## Warranty

- Powertrain
    - Covers all internally lubricated parts which makes car move forward and in reverse
       - Engine, transmission and other related pieces such as the differential
       - Wheel bearings
       - OFTEN just about anything involved in bringing power to the wheels, including a car's driveshaft and constant velocity joints.
- Bumper-to-bumper
    - Covers the powertrain, the electronics, the suspension, vehicle systems and more
    - Does not cover the bumper itself, which is considered "body panel"

- BUYER BEWARE
  - Don't get a warranty with a $500 deductible.  This is what the typical sleazy car financing person will try to sell you.

# Paying for a Car - True Costs
## Car Loan

- Even if you want to pay with cash, they may require you to get a loan in order to knock money off the car.
    - Watch out for them offering very high APRs, even if you have GREAT credit.  The first thing they will try to say is some excuse, such as "Oh, it's a used car, so the bank has more risk on the loan in case the car goes under."

## Dealer Closing Fees
- https://www.consumerreports.org/car-pricing-negotiation/watch-out-for-these-dealership-fees-when-buying-a-car/

## Understand Cost vs. Price
The cost of the car is not just the price you pay for it, but its scheduled maintenance costs.

## Filing a Consumer Complaint
- dealerrater.com
- https://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-consumer-complaint

### Scheduled Maintenance Log
- Check your owner's manual for the scheduled maintenance log
    - https://drivers.lexus.com/lexusdrivers/service/maintenance-schedules

### Reliability 
- Consistency across models and across years. Fewer changes mean less can go wrong, things can be slowly perfected, and the car engineers aren't chasing fashion trends at the expense of good design 
- 100 hp / liter metric
    - Most cars are designed to be in the 60-80 range. Most Lexus vehicles are in the 70 to 80 range. 
    - Sports cars often are highly tuned and efficient, but that efficiency creates stress on the engine. A Ferrari is over 100 hp / liter, and nobody buys a Ferrari to drive it 500k miles
