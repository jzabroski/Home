## Car Buying

### Sites
- www.cargurus.com
  - Advertises on SeekingAlpha, and many sports news sites and vBulletin sports discussion boards.
- www.autotrader.com

### Principles
- Understand the different between a "salvage title" and a "rebuilt title" or "reconstructed title".
    - Do not buy a car with a salvage title.
    - Do not buy a rebuilt/reconstructed car for more than 80% of it's bottom tier KBB value.
    - If the car has been in an accident, look for any frame rail damage, since frame damage can cause tires to wear unevenly, among other things.
- Check tread depth. New tires can easily cost $800 or more.
- Cars at 60,000 miles tend to require a lot of maintenance.  YourMechanic.com mobile site has good visual plot of maintenance over time.
- Never buy a BMW v8.  Known issues going back to 2004 that they have never fixed.  People who buy BMW v8 have money to do so brand new, and then afte the 4 year, 50k mile warranty, they dump it on whoever comes next.  Don't be that person that gets dumped on.

## Warranty

- Powertrain
    - Covers all internally lubricated parts which makes car move forward and in reverse
       - Engine, transmission and other related pieces such as the differential
       - Wheel bearings
       - OFTEN just about anything involved in bringing power to the wheels, including a car's driveshaft and constant velocity joints.
- Bumper-to-bumper
    - Covers the powertrain, the electronics, the suspension, vehicle systems and more
    - Does not cover the bumper itself, which is considered "body panel"

- BUYER BEWARE
  - Don't get a warranty with a $500 deductible.  This is what the typical sleazy car financing person will try to sell you.

## Car Loan

- Even if you want to pay with cash, they may require you to get a loan in order to knock money off the car.
    - Watch out for them offering very high APRs, even if you have GREAT credit.  The first thing they will try to say is some excuse, such as "Oh, it's a used car, so the bank has more risk on the loan in case the car goes under."
