> Some of the most insightful thinking about developments in the repo market over the past few months has been provided by Credit Suisse’s Zoltan Pozsar. He has been dissecting the evolution of the repo market for more than a year and was prescient in anticipating the kinds of problems that led to the Fed’s recent injection of funds. His analysis is detailed and nuanced, so that it is not possible to cover all that he details here.[10] What follows is a distillation of some of his key points and insights.

> "Just because the Fed is willing to do a massive amount of repos doesn’t mean end borrowers will be able to obtain financing at attractive rates on September 30," said Michael Cloherty, an interest rate strategist at RBC Capital Markets. "An intermediary is needed to get cash from the Fed to end borrowers, and new regulations make it expensive to be an intermediary on quarter-ends."

> Total reserves consist of both required reserves and excess reserves. Required reserves are active in the economy and serve as the fractional reserve base for banks to make loans, which keeps the economy moving. Excess reserves just sit back at the Fed itself and do not circulate, so for all intents and purposes they have no effect on economic activity.

> ### Shadow Liquidity Regulation
> But none of this explains why the big banks didn't fund the private repo market as repo rates rose sharply above the Fed's IOER rate. After all, since the repos we're talking about are temporary swaps of reserves for Treasury securities, banks that engage in them don't reduce their HQLAs. Yet they stand to profit when repo rates spike. But the LCR requirements were far from the only liquidity requirements big banks had to meet. "Banks," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at the peak of the turmoil, "have a tremendous amount of liquidity, but also have a tremendous amount of restraints on how they use that liquidity.” As Francisco Covas and Bill Nelson explain in a recent BPI post, besides Basel's LCR requirements the very largest U.S. banks are also "subject to non-public liquidity stress tests, non-public liquidity requirements associated with their resolution plans, and non-public ad hoc examiner mandates."

| Framework                   | System           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| "Ample Reserves" framework  | "Floor" system   |
| "Scarce Reserves" framework | "Channel" system |

> Under this approach, banks are willing to hold large amounts of deposits at the Fed because they are remunerated at market rates. This approach has been described as an “ample reserves” framework in contrast to the previous approach, which has been dubbed a “scarce reserves” framework. The new approach is also known as a “floor” system because the Fed’s IOER, set by fiat, establishes a floor on the federal funds rate. Under this approach, the Fed’s balance sheet will remain much larger than it was prior to the financial crisis.

> To explain this bizarre phenomenon in which the EFF has been trading well above IOER in defiance of all of the Fed's monetary orthodoxy, we laid out several possible explanations, including that i) money market outflows around the April 15 tax deadline date and elevated GC repo rates; ii) the continued decline in excess reserves, and most ominously iii) another acute dollar shortage  developing across the US banking system.

> For every US Treasury security outstanding, roughly three parties believe they own it. That’s right. Multiple parties report that they own the very same asset, when only one of them truly does. To wit, the IMF has estimated that the same collateral was reused 2.2 times in 2018, which means both the original owner plus 2.2 subsequent re-users believe they own the same collateral (often a US Treasury security).
> 
> This is why US Treasuries aren’t risk-free—they’re the most rehypothecated asset in financial markets, and the big banks know this. Auditors can’t catch this because GAAP accounting standards obfuscate it [...]
> 
> Financial regulators can’t publicly admit to this, but big banks know it’s true—and that’s why they hunker down (and stop lending) when they sense one of their kin is in trouble. They recognize that what appears to be an 8% risk-free arbitrage is anything but risk-free.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Auditors can’t help here, and the accounting profession bears some of the blame for this problem. In June 2014, FASB updated the US GAAP accounting rules for repos. Here’s what the books of three parties show when a transferee (Party A) sells pledged collateral to a third party (Party C):
> 
> * Party A owns a particular US Treasury Bond, showing an asset of $100.
> * Party B borrows it, showing a liability of $100 ($100 of securities sold, not yet purchased).
> * Party C shows an asset of $100.
> 
> If you add up the positions of all parties, economically there’s no problem because the net of the two longs and one short position add up to $100. The problem arises when you aggregate the three US GAAP financial statements. Both Party A and Party C report that they own the same asset (!) The balance sheets balance because Party B records a liability, so auditors don’t catch the problem. When that same bond is reused again and again and again in similar transactions, the magnitude of double counting within the financial system builds in a manner that no one can accurately measure.

> Shortly after the spike in repo rates, our initial view was that the events may be a catalyst for one of the following:
> 
> * A continuation of the Fed’s open market operations over the short term.
> * A standing Fed repo facility that allows banks to access cash when there is less liquidity.
> * A “soft” QE program. The Fed will purchase Treasuries, in turn raising reserves, to relieve potential stresses in the short-term funding markets. But Powell has said the Treasury bill purchases — though aimed at expanding the Fed’s balance sheet and bank reserves — should not be confused with the QE during and after the global financial crisis.
> 
> As mentioned above, the Fed has acted on both the first and third options by extending open market operations and purchasing Treasury bills. However, we have yet to see any material progress by the Fed in terms of a plan for a standing repo facility. We will be looking toward the upcoming October FOMC meeting for more guidance on this option.
> 
> We are also mindful that other seasonal and structural factors can create imbalances in the short-term markets. For example, the weeks leading up to bank regulatory reporting dates, particularly at year-end, typically coincide with decreased liquidity and funding pressures. While we expect the Fed to remain proactive in its efforts to promote stability, we believe it’s prudent to actively position portfolios ahead of these pressure points.
