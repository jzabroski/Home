> Shortly after the spike in repo rates, our initial view was that the events may be a catalyst for one of the following:
> 
> * A continuation of the Fed’s open market operations over the short term.
> * A standing Fed repo facility that allows banks to access cash when there is less liquidity.
> * A “soft” QE program. The Fed will purchase Treasuries, in turn raising reserves, to relieve potential stresses in the short-term funding markets. But Powell has said the Treasury bill purchases — though aimed at expanding the Fed’s balance sheet and bank reserves — should not be confused with the QE during and after the global financial crisis.
> 
> As mentioned above, the Fed has acted on both the first and third options by extending open market operations and purchasing Treasury bills. However, we have yet to see any material progress by the Fed in terms of a plan for a standing repo facility. We will be looking toward the upcoming October FOMC meeting for more guidance on this option.
> 
> We are also mindful that other seasonal and structural factors can create imbalances in the short-term markets. For example, the weeks leading up to bank regulatory reporting dates, particularly at year-end, typically coincide with decreased liquidity and funding pressures. While we expect the Fed to remain proactive in its efforts to promote stability, we believe it’s prudent to actively position portfolios ahead of these pressure points.
