# Advice from Mario G. (Wakefield)

1. To determine the legal status of the 2 family, I need to go to the Tax Assessor Office and look at the Field Card for the property.
2. Note, go to the Tax ASSESSOR Office, NOT the Tax COLLECTOR, office.
3. In Wakefield, if purchasing a home with an in-law suite, the buyer needs to re-apply for the in-law suite status prior to purchasing the home, or they will lose the in-law suite status. Transfering ownership of the property wipes clean the in-law suite status by default, unless the purchaser gets approval to retain that status.
