# Advice from Mario G. (Wakefield)

1. To determine the legal status of the 2 family, I need to go to the Tax Assessor Office and look at the Field Card for the property.
2. Note, go to the Tax ASSESSOR Office, NOT the Tax COLLECTOR, office.
3. In Wakefield, if purchasing a home with an in-law suite, the buyer needs to re-apply for the in-law suite status prior to purchasing the home, or they will lose the in-law suite status. Transfering ownership of the property wipes clean the in-law suite status by default, unless the purchaser gets approval to retain that status.

# Advice from Jared Kolinek

Just had my gas line installed in April after a 2 year wait. If you need it done ASAP, you will be told you need to dig your own trench. Not cheap and good luck finding someone to do it. I was able to get a list from WMGLD list of the approved vendors for the work. I called all of them and not one would do the job or get back to me. 

Also your street cannot be recently paved within the last 5 years. If it was, the town will not let them cut for the gas line. Reach out to Richard Spindler at WMGLD for the list. Good luck.

As others have said, definitely see if you can go all electric. WMGLD has many resources available to assist with information and rebates. Was cost prohibitive for me as I would have had to build out a utility room for a water heater.
