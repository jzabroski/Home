# Mortgage Loan Officer Perspective
- Temp employees income is effectively 0 in eyes of mortgage officer
- New business owners must have two year track record to obtain mortgage financing.  Does not matter if Schedule C, LLC, S-Corp, whatever.  What matters is date of incorporation and 2 year proof of income.
- Loan officer cannot see your previous credit terms.
  - Does not know if existing home is 10/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, or 30 year fixe
  - Does not know what the rate is on that home.
- If looking to buy multi-family primary residence homes, when you buy the second home, 75% of the gross rental income from the first home is applied to your monthly income / earning power in determining your ability to finance the next property.
