# Zillow iBuying Algorithm

https://dolinskigroup.com/selling-home/why-zestimate-so-low

> ## Zillow’s Data Is Missing Or Wrong
> When using an automated value model, like the Zestimate, data accuracy plays a critical role. In accurate data causes all sorts of problems with the Zestimate.
> 
> One common cause of data inaccuracy is data decay. Gartner reports that every month around 3 percent of data is decayed globally.
> 
> While this applies to all data, it’s reasonable to a degree to interpolate and assume that Zillow’s data is decayed by 3% every single month.
> 
> Without additional data points being added, like when a home is listed, the more decay that is going to happen. In other words, it’s reasonable to conclude that the longer a home is owned, the more likely the Zestimate is to be wrong.
> 
> For example, it’s common for homeowners to:
> 
> * Add bathrooms
> * Finish a basement
> * Add other amenities
> * Bump out their garage

...

> ## Poor Choice In Comparables
> Every good home valuation method relies on comparing your home to similar homes in the neighborhood that sold within a certain time frame given the real estate market’s conditions.
> 
> As a general rule of thumb, real estate agents and appraisers will look for similar homes that sold within the last six months.
> 
> Zillow’s Zestimate algorithm holds fast to this rule, regardless of market conditions. Six months is only a general rule and will be shifted based on how the real estate market is doing.
> 
> * In a seller’s market, like the one in 2021 and into 2022, comparables should be within 3 months.
> * In a buyer’s market, like the years during the Great Recession, comparables may be as far as 12 months out.
Given the inflationary period we are experiencing at the end of 2021, house values are climbing quickly. Zillow’s algorithm, unfortunately, doesn’t reflect this reality when it is pulling comparable homes that sold six months ago.

# Industry Consolidation

CostcoFinance.com is a major source of mortgages, and a brief history of those companies is as follows:

1. [WestStar Mortgage was acquired by J.G. Wentworth](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150310006572/en/J.G.-Wentworth-Company%E2%84%A2-Acquire-WestStar-Mortgage) on March 10, 2015 ([completed August 3, 2015](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150803005606/en/J.G.-Wentworth-Company%E2%84%A2%C2%A0Completes-Acquisition-WestStar-Mortgage)), which was in turn acquired by Freedom Mortgage.  Freedom Mortgage supposedly acquired J.G. Wentworth because they anticipated a drop in rates following the 2020 Presidential Election.
2. Following Western Mortgage being acquired, a faction of Western Mortgage started a new company and joined the Costco Finance portal.

## Loan Terminology
1. A *conforming loan* is any loan amount of $417,000 or less.
2. A *jumbo loan* is any loan greater than $417,000. Generally speaking, jumbo loans will have slightly higher interest rates than a conforming loan.
3. On January 1, 2009 the "*super conforming*" or "*agency jumbo*" loan was created for loan amounts up to $729,750.
4. *YSP* means [yield spread premium](https://www.thetruthaboutmortgage.com/mortgage-dictionary/yield-spread-premium/).
5. *BACKEND RATIO*
    > Also known as a debt-to-income ratio which is your total monthly obligations (debt) divided by your gross monthly income. Your monthly obligations include such items as your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance premiums, installment loans, and revolving debt (credit cards). This ratio is used to determine your capacity to repay the mortgage and all other debts. Your debt-to-income ratio is a crucial calculation in determining the loan amount for which you can qualify.
6. *PITI*
    > *P*rincipal, *I*nterest, *T*axes and *I*nsurance. The Principal and Interest can be either fixed for the term of the loan or changed at specific intervals in accordance with the terms of the loan program. The Taxes and Insurance portion may be adjusted to reflect changes in taxes and/or insurance costs.
7. PITI RATIO*
    > Compares the amount of the monthly income to the amount the borrower will owe each month in principal, interest, real estate tax and insurance on a mortgage. Lenders use it in deciding whether to give the borrower a loan. (Compare to Qualifying Income Ratio.)

    The broker charges a broker origination fee that is paid to the broker per loan transaction from the lender (assuming lender paid compensation).  The broker origination fee is paid to the broker.  The broker then pays the MLO (whatever compensation plan that is set with). Unless he/she is a producing broker, most broker's make their money on the volume of their MLO's, for obviously taking on the compliance of being the broker, and hopefully helping when needed, etc.

8. *CRA area* refers to Community Reinvestment Act area covered by a local bank.  The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a law intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations.

9. *Portfolio Mortgage*: See https://themortgagereports.com/29518/what-is-a-portfolio-mortgage

# Glossary
VOE: Verification of Employment 

# Mortgage Loan Officer Perspective
- Temp employees income is effectively 0 in eyes of mortgage officer
- New business owners must have two year track record to obtain mortgage financing.  Does not matter if Schedule C, LLC, S-Corp, whatever.  What matters is date of incorporation and 2 year proof of income.
- Loan officer cannot see your previous credit terms.
  - Does not know if existing home is 10/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, or 30 year fixe
  - Does not know what the rate is on that home.
- If looking to buy multi-family primary residence homes, when you buy the second home, 75% of the gross rental income from the first home is applied to your monthly income / earning power in determining your ability to finance the next property.
