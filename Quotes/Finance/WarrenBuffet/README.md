From Warren Buffet's 2019 letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway:

> # The Power of Retained Earnings
> 
> In 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long Term Investments,
> a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,
> forcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.
> 
> Going in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods and that bonds 
> would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was in for a shock
> 
> His book began, therefore, with a confession: “These studies are the record of a failure – the failure of factsto sustain a preconceived theory.”
> Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocks should be evaluated.
> 
> For the crux of Smith’s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard Keynes: 
> “I have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith’s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point. Well-managed industrial companies do not,
> as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits 
> and put them back into the business. Thus _there is an element of compound interest_ (Keynes’ italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. 
> Over a period of years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from thedividends paid out to 
> the shareholders.”
> 
> And with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.
> 
> It’s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith’s book was published. After all, it was no secret that 
> mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,Rockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business 
> earnings to fund growth and produceever-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich following 
> the same playbook.
> 
> Nevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces – “stocks” – buyers in the pre-Smithyears usually thought of their shares as a 
> short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks wereconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.
> 
> Though investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now wellunderstood. Today, school children learn what 
> Keynes termed “novel”: combining savings with compound interestworks wonders.
