> I think the story here is that Bitcoin is digital gold, and it's engineered to be like gold, but superior to gold, in all aspects.
> And it's also the world's first digital monetary network. So, imagine a block of billion dollars of gold, that moves at the speed of light,
> that you can program a million times a second, in order to provide a framework for the 21st century finance system.
> This is monetary technology, and just like all Big Tech, it's making financial systems more efficient.

> I don't think it's going to replace the [US] dollar.  I think that what happens is bitcoin is replacing gold as a non-sovereign store of value,
> running on a big tech network.

> It took us months to work through the issues.  We uploaded our corporate playbook for bitcoin, and open sourced it to the rest of the world,
> and now it just takes days. [...] 1,000 corporations attended our webinar.  Quarter of a million views in just a couple of days.
