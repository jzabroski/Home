We probably just had a Orville and Wilbur Kitty Hawk moment in science--and the analysts want to know why "only 59 seconds?" ~ SeekingAlpha user [dunwoody_joe](https://seekingalpha.com/user/1099753/comments), commenting on [Sangamo's Gene Therapy Results](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4204400-sangamos-gene-therapy-results)

Consistency means not only using the same ratios or formulas; it also means using the correct time period. Let's use a simple example: Think about depositing $10,000 in a bank on January 1. At the end of the year, you receive your statement and see your interest for the year was $1,000, bringing your year-end balance to $11,000. *What is the return on your investment for the year?* It is 10% ()the year's earnings of $1,000 divided by the initial investmment, or opening balance, of $10,000). However, when we calculated ROA (ROE) above, we divided the income for the year by the assets (equity) at year-end. This calculation is comparable to divdiing the $1,000 of interest by the $11,000 year-end balance, giving a return of 9.1%, which is not correct. To accurately measure the yearly return on the assets invested, we need to divide the total yearly income by the initial investment, which is the beginning-of-the-year amount of total assets or equity.

    Initial Investment on January 1st = $10,000
    Ending Investment on December 31st = $11,000
    Earnings = $11,000 - $10,000 = $1,000
    Return on investment = ?
    The **correct** return calculation is: Earnings/Initial Investment = $1,000/$10,000 = 10%
    The **incorrect** return calculation is: Earnings/Ending Investment = $1,000/$11,000 = 9.1%
  
Analysts often mistakenly divide income by end-of-year assets or equity to determine ROA or ROE. They do this because the numbers are readily available on each year's Income Statement and Balance Sheet. In contrast, many textbooks, when dividing an Income Statement number by a Balance Sheet number, average the Balance Sheet number over the year. The average is usually computed as the average of the begin-of-year (which is the same as the end of the previous year) and end-of-year balances. This alternative may make sense if a firm is growing rapidly and additional investments are being made during the year. However, in general, the opening numbers provide a more realistic ratio.
