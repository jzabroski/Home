Q: as a leader, at what point am I allowed to go to others and say, "I need you," because I recognize I am not capable of pushing forward on my own. Or, should that be an instance where I take a step back and apply more discipline to my life, find a way to push forward by myself. 

A: Okay, you are allowed to say that to your team member, immediately. That you need them. Absolutely. If you -- of course you need your team, because, why would they be there? If you can do everything yourself, then you don't have a team. Right? You just do everything yourself.

So, while you, of course, should be working hard and you should be applying discipline... As a leader, it's your job to actually lead things. And to let other people support and make things happen. And there's nothing wrong with that. And also, you don't want to be stuck in the weeds doing minute things.

So, if you're not capable-- I think what may be holding this individual back. There's two things. 

1. I feel like I should take extreme ownership of everything. I feel like I should just do everything myself. That is not what extreme ownership is. And also, what can come into play is, your ego, because you don't know how to do something yourself.
