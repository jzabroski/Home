# Leaders lead by focusing on & measuring the controllable inputs of the organization

> "[We] believe that focusing our energy on the controllable inputs to our business is the most effective way to maximize financial outputs over time."
> 
> ~ Jeff Bezos

> "As a leader, you do not want to focus on just your outputs, rather you want to see yourself as a function of your inputs to achieve the optimal output [...]
> If you managed people according to their outputs, then your best people will tackle the short-term conservative projects they know will drive outputs to at least some degree.
> Instead if you manage to their inputs and clarity of thinking, your best people will focus on projects that have the highest potential upside that is explainable,
> even if they are risky and totally flop."
> 
> ~ Keith Rabois & Delian Asparouhov
