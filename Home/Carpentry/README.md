Interesting video that goes into board deflection with a visual demo of the difference in deflection from 16" to 12" spacing.

# Fascia Boards

https://www.fiberondecking.com/faq/what-are-fascia-and-riser-boards-and-how-do-i-install-them

> Fascia and riser boards are thinner and wider versions of deck boards that serve as a non-structural covering for rim joists, stair risers, and stringers. They are sometimes referred to as “skirts” or “trim” boards.
> 
> Because fascia and riser boards are thin, Fiberon recommends installing them using 2.5" #8 or #10 stainless steel or composite screws installed flush to the board surface. We do NOT recommend using Cortex face fasteners because there is simply not enough material available for the screw to be properly seated.
