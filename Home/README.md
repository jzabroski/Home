> Most people [maybe not in this country] believe that humans evolved outdoors, and are designed to breathe fresh air.  In the modern world we spend significant amounts of time
in buildings. Once the cost of heating started to rise in the 1970's we began to take measure to conserve heat in our homes and make them more energy efficient. In doing this we have sealed up homes, often to an extent that can become unhealthy.

> The lack of adequate ventilation can lead to high levels of relative humidity and promote condensation on cold building materials (exterior walls, windows, toilet tanks, carpeting laid
on poorly insulated flooring...) this moisture can easily promote mold growth and that can contribute to respiratory irritation. The lack of adequate ventilation can also contribute to the buildup of "other pollutants" such as: VOC's fragrances, cleaning agents, cosmetics, etc.

> These "other pollutants" are costly to test for, but are almost always alleviated by improving ventilation.
