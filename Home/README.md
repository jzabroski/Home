# Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)

> Most people [maybe not in this country] believe that humans evolved outdoors, and are designed to breathe fresh air.  In the modern world we spend significant amounts of time
in buildings. Once the cost of heating started to rise in the 1970's we began to take measure to conserve heat in our homes and make them more energy efficient. In doing this we have sealed up homes, often to an extent that can become unhealthy.
>
> The lack of adequate ventilation can lead to high levels of relative humidity and promote condensation on cold building materials (exterior walls, windows, toilet tanks, carpeting laid
on poorly insulated flooring...) this moisture can easily promote mold growth and that can contribute to respiratory irritation. The lack of adequate ventilation can also contribute to the buildup of "other pollutants" such as: VOC's fragrances, cleaning agents, cosmetics, etc.
>
> These "other pollutants" are costly to test for, but are almost always alleviated by improving ventilation.

> 1. Use a PID meter instead of a consumer grade sensor. These low cost sensors do not have the stability, resolution or consistency to really know how well any air purifier really reduces VOCs.
> 2. Do not test in a small enclosed chamber. This will greatly increase the Air Exchange Rate and and over estimate any positive reading.
> 3. Do not use high concentration of a single VOC in a small enclosure. Use the mix of multiple VOCs we find in homes.
> 4. Test in real living spaces where the TVOC levels are > 500ng/liter. See if levels can be lowered below 500ng/liter.
> 5. Better yet do before and and after Gas Chromatography readings in real rooms with ambient VOC concentrations. That's the gold standard.
