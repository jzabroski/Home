# R-10 Windows
https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/question/budget-concern-better-to-buy-the-r-10-windows-with-less-great-walls

> A budget crunch forces some tough decisions. Most of the bidders prefer using 2x6s instead of the double stud wall, and using American R-2.5 to 3 windows over the European R-10 ones. My general knowledge is that heat always moves to warm up what is cold, therefore keeping our R-10 windows in the design seems like the place to spend our money. This would mean backing down to an overall R-22 wall (2x6s 24″ oc, exterior 1.5″ Zip System and another 1″ of rigid insulation, well sealed batt or rock wool in the cavity). Alternatively, we could shift the money to get spray foam everywhere if we went with the less insulated windows. I can not find research on the matter. I suppose another insight that I would enjoy would be the value of the R-40 double stud wall when combined with the R-2.5 windows. This is for RI, low Zone 5, and windows make up about 25 – 30% of the exterior wall. Thanks, Will

The U-factors of framed wall assemblies have to be calculated or estimated, since cavity insulation is only a fraction of the cross sectional area, and has a different R-value than the framing fraction of the area, and the continuous layers of wallboard, sheathing, siding, and insulating sheathing all have their own R-values that add into the total. A typical wood-sheathed 2x6 wall with R20 cavity fill comes in at about R13-R15 whole-wall depending on the actual framing fraction and the siding & sheathing types, etc. The R-value of any continuous exterior insulation gets added directly to the stackup. The 1" ZIP-R adds about R6 over a conventional OSB wall, so that brings the whole-wall up to about R20, but mid-winter performance will be less than that in an RI location due to the low-temperature characteristics of it's polyisocyanurate insulation layer- call it R18-R19, unless you put at least 2" of exterior rock wool or EPS on the exterior of the ZIP-R to keep the polyiso warm enough to keep it in it's higher-performance range.

> Upgrading the cavity insulation to a high R/inch insulation has remarkably little boost to the whole-wall performance due to the thermal bridging of the framing. (R-1,000,000 cavity fill only brings a 2x6 wall up to about R17 or so average performance after thermal bridging.) Using less expensive cavity fill and spending it on thicker insulating sheathing (that isn't thermally bridged by framing) is a far better value.
