> When Mark Fields was tapped to replace Alan Mulally as Ford Motor Co.’s new CEO back in the summer of 2014, my phone started ringing off the hook.
> 
> Reporters wanted to know what I, as the author of American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company, thought of Fields and his prospects. I told them all the same thing: “Alan has given Mark the skills he needs to run Ford and left him with a management system and strategic vision that can ensure the company’s future success.”
> 
> But I also offered an important caveat.
> 
> “It’s going to take a big man to sit on his hands and not try to fix what isn’t broken,” I warned. “That is what Ford needs, and time will tell if Mark Fields can do that.”
> [...]
> “Mark had to make it his own,” one of those sources told me today. “Unfortunately, his vision and his strategy were not as clear, nor as effective. Mark layered on a lot of things. Our priorities became clouded, and that really slowed decision making.”
