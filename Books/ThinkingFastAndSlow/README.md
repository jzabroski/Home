Here is the refutation being referred to in the article, the article author did a poor job explaining it, and the reason to reject isn't "effect is too large", because the effect is real -- but this study explains it https://journal.sjdm.org/16/16823/jdm16823.html

1. Prisoners are ordered by whether they have an attorney (so those going last in a session are self-represented)

2. Judges order prisoners often by "complexity of the case", so the ones taking most time are first (and therefore most likely to have a favorable decision, a short/easy case is probably a no-parole situation)

3. Statistically, the cases that gained parole take longer than those that don't, so even if they are random/normally distributed, then if one falls at the end, it will come back to the beginning of next session. A simulation shows that even with random ordering, you still get the same graph (because the long/complex cases that could be paroled tend to be moved to next session when the session is almost out of time).

So after reading this, the graph means: Ratio of cases with a lawyer that can be finished in the remaining time in the session.

Both values are decreasing as the session continues, so it produces a heavy down sloping graph that resets each session to some approximately random value (.65).



# Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

Correlation between ability to control their attention and control their emotions.

The supervisory function of System 2 is weak in these people, and found they are prone to answer questions with the first idea that comes to mind,
and unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions.  
Also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. They are impulsive, impatient, and prone to immediate gratification.

The low scorers on the cognitive reflection test, are willing to pay twice as much as the high scorers.

## Keith Stanovitch and Richard West

- Introduced System 1 and System 2. Now use Type 1 and Type 2.
- One basic quesiton, in many different ways:
  - What makes people more susceptible than others, to biases of judgment?
    - Published in book, "Rationality and the Reflective Mind".
      1. Algorithmic, slow thinking.
      2. Rationality.  Should be distinguished from intelligence.  Superficial, lazy thinking is a failure of rational mind.

# Chapter 4: The Associative Machine

## "Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconcious" by Timothy D. Wilson. Narrated by Joe Barrett

Mentioned at end of chapter.

System 1 provides impressions that often turns into your beliefs.  And, is the source of the impulses, that often become your choices and actions.

Links present with the recent past.

Model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising.

# Chapter 5: Cognitive Ease

- Aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed, than when they did not.

- Turkish companies analyzed by brokerage analyst firms.  Easier to pronounce firm name was ignored/discarded in favor of easier to pronounce name.

- Psychologists believe all of us live much of our lives guided by the impressions of System 1.

# Chapter 7: A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

# Chapter 8: How Judgments Happen

- Situations are constantly evaluated.
- "Good Mood" and "Cognitive Ease", are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity.
- Identifying "Friend" and "Foe".  

## Alexander Todorov

- Accuracy of Face Reading.
  - Not perfect. But imperfect ability confers survival advantage.
  - "Valence" and "Dominance" predict winning and losing, suggesting we are biologically pre-disposed to elect candidates with facial characteristics we prefer

  - Politically uninformed voters who watch a great deal of television.
  - Effect of "facial competence on voting" is about 3 times larger for "information poor" and "TV prone" voters.
    - How did they determine what "information poor" is?

    >  In one study of fifty-eight gubernatorial races, the only element that outperformed the thin-slice impression was a combination of two of the political factors most closely tied to electoral success: incumbency status and campaign spending. While we are never forced to vote based on one factor alone, the apparent predictive power of competence judgements reveal how deeply that quick impression may color our evaluation of more serious considerations.

    > The more data that Todorov gathered, the stronger his conclusion seemed. A few years after his initial research, he determined that even a one-second cutoff was unnecessary—the judgments that people made after a mere hundred milliseconds predicted election outcomes just as accurately as if they’d had an unlimited time to look at the photographs. **But the more that his subjects reflected on their impressions—if they were asked explicitly to make a good judgment and think carefully about their choice—the less accurately their responses tracked with actual outcomes, and they became no different than a chance guess.** Moreover, he found that judgments of trust and likability were not nearly as predictive as judgments of competence. It was competence alone that had the snap-judgment predictive power.

  - Number of birds does not matter.
  - People react to the negative image of a single bird drowning.
