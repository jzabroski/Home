_Thinking, Fast and Thinking Slow_, by Daniel Kahneman

# Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller

Correlation between ability to control their attention and control their emotions.

The supervisory function of System 2 is weak in these people, and found they are prone to answer questions with the first idea that comes to mind,
and unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions.  
Also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. They are impulsive, impatient, and prone to immediate gratification.

The low scorers on the cognitive reflection test, are willing to pay twice as much as the high scorers.

## Keith Stanovitch and Richard West

- Introduced System 1 and System 2. Now use Type 1 and Type 2.
- One basic quesiton, in many different ways:
  - What makes people more susceptible than others, to biases of judgment?
    - Published in book, "Rationality and the Reflective Mind".
      1. Algorithmic, slow thinking.
      2. Rationality.  Should be distinguished from intelligence.  Superficial, lazy thinking is a failure of rational mind.
