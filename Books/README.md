Agile Data Warehouse Design: Collaborative Dimensional Modeling, from Whiteboard to Star Schema
By Lawrence Carr and Jim Stagnitto


> The history of data infrastructure is littered with designs 
that were based on short-term thinking to solve the 
problem of the moment. The lesson of this approach 
during both the mainframe reporting and data 
warehouse eras was that systems intended to be data 
platforms have a long life, and that weak architectures 
end up as data junkyards where data goes to die.
