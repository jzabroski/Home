# Takeaways

- As a general principle, it is important to look for evidence that discriminates between hypotheses. It is especially important to look for evidence that can falsify a hypothesis (Karl Popper). Falsification is a more powerful discrimination tool than confirmation.

- The goal of Analysis of Competing Hypothesis (ACH) thinking tool is to get a deeper understanding of the range of possible explanations of reality and of the evidence that supports/refutes these world views. The resulting probabilities assigned to each Hypothesis are a reflection of that understanding (and not the main objective of the exercise).

# Introduction

1. Douglas McEachin - Linchpin Analysis.  Less academic way to say key variables.

2. "Perception: Why Can't We See What Is There to Be Seen?"
   - Encourage Products That:
       - Clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference.
       - Specify the degree and source of uncertainty involved in the conclusions.
       - Emphasize procedures that expose and elaborate alternative points of view.
       - Analytic Debates.
       - Devil's Advocate.
       - Interdisciplinary brainstorming.
       - Competitive Analysis.
       - Intra-office peer review of production
       - Elicitation of outside expertise.
      
3. Dangers of Mental Models or Mindsets. 
      
   - Analysts construct their own version reality, 
   - On the basis of information provided by the senses,
   - But mediated by complex mental processes
   - determine what information is attended to,
   - how it is organized, what meaning people attribute to it
   - what people perceive, how readily they perceive it, and how they process this information after receiving it
   - all strongly influenced by past experiences, education, cultural values, role requirements and organizational norms, 
   - specific of information received

  - Analsysts Need More than Information
    -
    - Mental Models are necessary evil to help sound analysis of complex issues  
    - Challenge, refine, and challenge their own mental models.
    - Orthodox prescription of: More and better information

  - Mirror Imaging is an Unavoidable Cognitive Trap

  - Too often, foreign behavior 

  - Analysts often reject deception

> ### Sagan's fine art of baloney detection - an enterprise review
> Pickings and Popova pulled Sagan's rules from his book, [The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark](https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469), via the chapter "The Fine Art of Baloney Detection." Here's nine rules of scientific inquiry Sagan believes we can apply to everyday life - along with my take on the enterprise relevance of each.
> 
> 1. Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”
> 2. Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.
> 3. Arguments from authority carry little weight — "authorities" have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.
> 4. Spin more than one hypothesis. If there's something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among "multiple working hypotheses," has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.
> 5. Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it's yours. It's only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don't, others will.
> 6. Quantify. If whatever it is you're explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you'll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.
> 7. If there's a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.
> 8. Occam's Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler
> 9. Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.

Alternatively:

1. How reliable is the source of the claim?
2. Does this source often make similar claims?
3. Have the claims been verified by another source?
4. How does this claim fit with what we know about how the world works?
5. Has anyone gone out of the way to disprove the claim, or has only supportive evidence been sought?
6. Does the preponderance of evidence point to the claimant's conclusion or to a different one?
7. Is the claimant employing the accepted rules of reason and tools of research, or have these been abandoned in favor of others that lead to the desired conclusion?
8. Is the claimant providing an explanation for the observed phenomena or merely denying the existing explanation?
9. If the claimant prefers a new explanation, does it account for as many phenomena as the old explanation did?
10. Do the claimaint's personal beliefs and biases drive the conclusions, or vice versa?

## GoExplore ACH Manual

### Methodology
As explained in the GoExplore ACH Manual, the method for this technique consists of three steps:

1. Imagine a wide range of hypotheses.
2. Investigate evidence and arguments and map against hypotheses.
3. Repeat.
