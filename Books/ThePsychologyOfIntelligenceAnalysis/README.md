2. "Perception: Why Can't We See What Is There to Be Seen?"
   - Encourage Products That:
       - Clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference.
       - Specify the degree and source of uncertainty involved in the conclusions.
       - Emphasize procedures that expose and elaborate alternative points of view.
       - Analytic Debates.
       - Devil's Advocate.
       - Interdisciplinary brainstorming.
       - Competitive Analysis.

3. Dangers of Mental Models or Mindsets. 
      
   - Analysts construct their own version reality, 
   - On the basis of information provided by the senses,
   - But mediated by complex mental processes
   - determine what information is attended to,
   - how it is organized, what meaning people attribute to it
   - what people perceive, how readily they perceive it, and how they process this information after receiving it
   - all strongly influenced by past experiences, education, cultural values, role requirements and organizational norms, 
   - specific of information received

  - Analsysts Need More than Information
    -
    - Mental Models are necessary evil to help sound analysis of complex issues  
    - Challenge, refine, and challenge their own mental models.
    - Orthodox prescription of: More and better information

  - Mirror Imaging is an Unavoidable Cognitive Trap

  - Too often, foreign behavior 

  - Analysts often reject deception
