## Tape 1

Starts off by telling a group of sales people that while the premise is people come to a sales training workshop to learn how to be a better sales person, it's a farce. Every sales person already believes they're the best and don't need to improve. And predicts the audience will disagree with and ignore his advice.

In the 1970s, Tommy Hopkins, Zig Ziglar, Xerox, Dale Carnegie,  etc. Added a twist: Ask questions. 

In the 1950s, Sell the Sizzle was great stuff, but the problem became that the person you are selling to already knows all those lines.

In the 60s, went from "rapport" to "dog and pony show".

They found out through research that you had to close five times:
1. This is a red letter day in your life
2. Do you want a goose that lays the golden eggs or the golden eggs
3. The God close

1967, someone made 116,000 in first year. Someone asked how did you do it. He spent 2 minutes. Work hard, 7 days a week, nose to the grindstone.

Then David Sandler spends 2 hours explaining 30 minutes.
