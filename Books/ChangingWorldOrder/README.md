1. Does the story consist of emotionally triggering, unsubstantiated accusations?
   Or are the facts substantiated and the sources provided?
   When the facts are put aside to create an exciting story and the sources are undisclosed, don't believe the story.

3. Are the accusations in the story consistent with what has been identified and proven in the legal system?
   If people or groups are accused in the media of doing bad things, but they haven't been accused and judged to have done bad things in the legal system,
   which follows a process that tries to weigh the evidence to get at what is true, at least ask yourself, why that is?  And probably don't believe the story.
4. If the writer or outlet has previously shown themselves to be bias, assume that they or their stories are bias.

> and I can see from that, that the picture would not have been crystal clear, that the British empire would go on to become the dominant world empire. If I were
> alive in the early 1700s, and looking at my indicators, I would have seen the Dutch still at their peak, and urban France as a major power on the rise also, and
> I would have seen bullish conditions for them both at that time.
