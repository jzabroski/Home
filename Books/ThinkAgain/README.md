# Rethinking Cycle

## List of areas we're ignorant

1. Start with humility.
2. Question our understanding.
3. "Humility drives doubt, which feuls curiosity, motivates discovery, and re-inforces humility."

# Over-confidence Cycle

Validation makes us arrogant.  We don't test our beliefs.  Pride can give too much conviction.

# Re-think but also Care for the Vision/Mission
Visions for change are more compelling when they include visions of continuity.
Ex: apple is not a phone company, it's a computer company putting the best computers inside phones.

> "Two kinds of detachment are particularly useful for clear thinking: detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity."
> -- Adam Grant

1. Detaching yourself from your past self from present self.  Rethink who you are.  But be able to have a continuous story of how you got to who you are from who you were.
2. Detaching your opinions.  Be passionately dispassionate.  Jean Pierre predicting Trump would win.  Paid more attention to factors that were hard to quantify but more predictive.  **Forecasting skill is less of what we know, 3x forecaster success was how often they updated their beliefs.**

Superforecasters shows that the best forecasters revise their predictions only a few more times than non-superforecasters, and were willing to update their beliefs as new evidence came in.
