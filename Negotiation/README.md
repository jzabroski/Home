[When your anchor sinks your boat: Information asymmetry in distributive negotiations and the disadvantage of making the first offer](http://journal.sjdm.org/17/17327a/jdm17327a.html)
by Yossi Maaravi and Aharon Levy

> The literature on behavioral decision-making and negotiations to date usually advocates first-mover advantage in distributive negotiations,
> and bases this preference on the anchoring heuristic. In the following paper, we suggest that the preference for moving first vs. moving 
> second in negotiations may not be as clear-cut as presumed, especially in situations characterized by information asymmetry between negotiating 
> counterparts. In Study 1, we examined people’s initiation preferences and found that unless taught otherwise, people intuitively often prefer 
> to move second. In Studies 2–4, we experimentally tested the suggested advantage of moving second, and demonstrated that in information-asymmetry 
> scenarios – when one party has perfect background information and the other has none — it is actually preferable for both counterparts not to give the 
> first offer while negotiating. We discuss the implications of our findings on the field of negotiation and decision-making, and lay the groundwork for 
> future studies examining this issue.
