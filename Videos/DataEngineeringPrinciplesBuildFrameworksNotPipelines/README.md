# SIMPLE IS BETTER THAN COMPLEX

1. Save extract
2. Transform + Load
3. Save Transform,
4. LOAD
5. Validate on extract, before saving extract 
6. Vidate after load

# Principles
1. Understand the data consumer
2. Understand the data
3. Keep data in its raw form
4. Don't delete or move your raw data
5. Validate your extracted data before saving
6. Transform your data over all time: T(x, t) not T(x)
7. Separate your E-TL
8. Minimize the number of data and compute nodes
9. Store all your data if practically feasible to do so
10. Make your ETL acyclical
11. Validate your data before its given to consumers
12. Join your data at the database level
13. Monitor your data
