My Notes:

**Be** ***efficient*** **in your** ***practice***. Don't just teach yourself how to program well.  Teach yourself how to program efficiently.  Try programming something in 30 minutes, then take a break.  The simplest distillation of this idea comes from a book title I just love: [Golf Tough: Practice, Prepare, Perform and Progress](https://www.amazon.com/Golf-Tough-Practice-Prepare-Progress/dp/1909125504).

**Beware developing** ***state-dependent memory***\*.\* State-dependent memory is the idea that if you study for an exam after a party you've been drinking out, you're inebriated and you will only be able to recall what you've studied while you're inebriated.  And this idea doesn't just apply to staying sober.  If you're expecting to sit down and read straight-through without stopping all 300 pages of Jon Skeet's *C# In Depth* book, chances are you're not doing yourself any favors.  As awful as it sounds, I used to do this to myself when I was a teenager aspiring to be John Carmack.

***Determine if you're learning a Concept or a Fact***.Concept: Something you can put into your own words.Fact: Something you can look up.

Knowing if you're learning a Concept or a Fact will help cue you to the optimal strategy for learning in the moment.  As humans, we can adjust on the fly.  With Concepts, take the time to discover the meaning of it.

**How to judge your ability to do understanding learning (concepts)?  Do brain hacks to maximize your short-term working memory.**

Deliberately dump your short-term memory.  Short-term memory lasts only for 20 to 30 seconds.  The human brain will lose track of facts when distracted by moving to another task.  Set a timer to force interrupt yourself and do some unrelated, pre-programmed task.  You can even build an Alexa app to do this for you, so that Alexa calls out some tasks for you to do.

**Takes Notes; Don't Expect You'll Remember Everything**.

Think About It, Rather than Superficially Thinking About It.

***Form Study Groups***. Informally, [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) is great place to co-study new technologies.  However, it is not as focused as getting everyone to agree on committing to learn and discuss some concept.  Some work places, like Galois Tech and Google, have "brown bag lunches" where there are talks dedicated to learning something.  Most major cities also have "hackathons" where you can meet random people and work on a project together.

***Don't Conflate Recollection with Recognition***. Have you ever taken a quiz and thought, "I studied, but I can't remember a thing!"  The problem is you didn't recall the knowledge, you recognized it.

***Sleep 8 Hours***.

The brain has a consolidation process where it moves transitory long-term memory to consolidated, permanent memory. This appears to happen mostly during rapid eye movement sleep, which is the deepest part of the sleep cycle.  When you sleep less, you get less REM.  Is becoming a great programmer important to you?  Then consider giving up activities that are ruining your sleep schedule.  Either you're doing too much or destroying yourself with simply unhealthy behaviors.

Don't listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger about "[Sleep faster](https://youtu.be/bQxqIKTO2Ck?t=412)."   You're a programmer, not a last action hero.

***Explain What You Don't Understand and Ask Questions About What You Don't Understand***.

Learning is a process.  Re-capitulating what you just learned, and recognizing gaps in your knowledge, will help focus you on closing those mental gaps.  Writing out problems in your own words, even just self-dialogue, will help you assess what you truly don't understand.  Some engineers call this [Rubberduck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and literally have a Rubberduck on their desk that they talk to when they're in a jam.  "One piece of research said, *'80% of your study time is best spent reciting, and only 20% reading.'*"

***Teach Yourself How to use a Textbook***

Most students have not been taught how to use a textbook.  [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) is a pedagogical technique *every* textbook follows: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.

There's a lot more from this YouTube video, so I suggest you watch it and make your own notes (and feel free to link me back to your notes so we can compare and bootstrap together).

Some additional advice from me:

***Imitate, then duplicate, then surpass***\*.\*  Try reading the best C# developers' blogs and/oror twitter feed. Here are a few great engineers: David Fowler, Eric Lippert, Jon Skeet, Nick Craver, Daniel Cazzulino, Bart DeSmet, Claire Novotny, Jan Kotas, Miguel de Icaza.

***Surround yourself with clear thinkers***.  Programming is a profession of logic.  Being around illogical people will likely bog you down from maximizing your potential.  If you have family members who don't have your level of intellect, still be respectful.

***Surround yourself with creative people***.  Only part of programming is coding algorithms effectively.  The best programmers also have a flutter of creativity and see connections others do not.  Usually, they have very interesting friends who provide creative support.
