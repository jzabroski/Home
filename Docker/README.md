# What is Docker?
Metaphor: A docker was a laborer who moved commercial goods into and out of ships when they docked at seaports.
There were boxes and items of differing sizes and shapes, 
and experienced dockers were prized for their ability to fit goods into ships by hand in cost-effective ways.

Hiring people to move stuff around wasn't cheap, but there was no alternative.
