# Invincible, by Pascal Jousselin.
Imbattable (Invincible) is a superhero who bends the rules of comics.  Comic by Pascal Jousselin

> Jousselin creates the ultimate comic book for fans of comic book storytelling here. The characters are likable and interesting, but the way he uses the page and panel layouts to "cheat" in his storylines is super clever. The further the book goes along, the deeper the questions his story asks, too. Jousselin isn't repeating himself in this book. He's building up on everything, questioning the use of panel gutters as time travel mechanisms. So good!
