      > Upon sharing our findings with Microsoft in August 2018, new security notes were added to the code documentation as can be seen here: https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/pull/502. Our whitepaper should also contain almost all of the methods and classes in the .NET Framework that have security notes at the time of writing which might also be useful.
