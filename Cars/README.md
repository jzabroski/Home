## Cleaning Car Leather

### Do

Use micro fiber towel only for "dry" dusting; for wet wiping, mist spray direct and use heavy duty lint-free terry towel instead; for extraction.

### Don't

Water alone may not be effective for long term appearance care.

Thus, care products should not be alcohol based or alkaline to reduce cleaning side effects such as:

1. Streaks
2. Brightness
3. Tackiness
4. Stiffness

A comprehensive leather care for fake leather has one less area to worry: the fabric backing, unlike real leather will not stiffen that leads to cracks.

The surface maintenance is still the same and is recommended to do it on a scheduled maintenance program. 

The scheduled maintenance cycle involves:

1. Surface Protection
2. Routine Care
3. Periodic Care
4. Restorative Care
5. Spot & Stain Care

The objective of such a program is to keep the appearance level high at all time; a smooth buttery-feel protection to reduce noise and friction rubs and to impart an optional leather-scent to charm.

### Protection:

This is done when the leather is new or after periodic or restorative cleaning cycle.

The objective is to impart a natural buttery-feel to reduce surface friction wear and to deter against sticky soiling. 

Bare body on contact will not feel as if you are stuck to the surface but easily glide across. 

It comes with scentless or leather scented, making whatever leather more real.

### Routine Care:

This is done weekly to monthly depends on usage.

My recommendation is use the micro fiber towel for "dry dusting" only.

Use a high quality lint-free heavy weight terry towel for all wet wiping or extraction.

Besides water, another option is to use an acidic pH 3.0 rinse to neutralize sweat build-up, especially steering wheels and the gear shift knob.

Thereafter resume with your favorite smooth buttery-feel protection, scentless or leather-scented.

### Periodic Care:

This is done from monthly to half yearly depending on usage.

Again acidic pH cleaner is recommended to remove body oil, grease and sweat together with other surface contamination.

Notice that the surface of the leather is not entirely smooth, but grainy with stitching holes and seams and perforated holes, and creases and wrinkles is where the routine care soiling may have spread into and being trapped and accumulated there.

This is done with a detailing horsehair Brush-1, with fine bristle that will not even scratch our skin, not quite possibly done with towel or foam sponge.

Thereafter resume with your favorite smooth buttery-feel protection, scentless or leather-scented.

### Restorative Care:

This is done on a half-yearly to a 2-yearly basis depends on usage.

Or check used areas appearance against unused area for comparison even after the car is return from workshop.

This cleaning cycle is to remove all the protection and soiling periodic care left behind to the original leather finish.

Thereafter resume with your favorite smooth buttery-feel protection, scentless or leather-scented.

### Spot & Stain Care:

Well, besides the scheduled care cycle, there is also the possible accidental stain like ink, tar, dyes and it is wise to have a kit that can handle all that is mentioned.

So you would be lack of nothing . . . what do you think?
