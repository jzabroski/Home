> People don’t know about Mazda 6 oil dilution problems because no one buys them. There are plenty of people on their forums complaining about it and have oil analysis test to show it. The same with the Elantra sport Di, go visit the forums.

> According to the IIHS.ORG website the halogen headlights are rated marginal. I hope that the LEDs in the top trim CRV are better. I recommend everybody look at the IIHS.ORG website to look at the headlight ratings for any cars they are considering buying. The RAV4 headlights go from Good to Poor depending on trim level - and the annoying thing is that buying a higher trim car doesn’t necessarily equate to better headlights. Which brings me to a burning question:

> Why is it so difficult (as judged by the number of vehicles that measure less than wonderfully) to design great headlights?? Going back to the RAV4, how is it that the engineers put worse headlights in their top trim than lower trims? Lexus has the same problem - the rx350 top trim curve-adaptive headlights measure worse than the base trim model. And Dodge hasn’t been able to design and implement anything but Poor rated headlights in the Charger! I get that styling is a factor but com,on already!
