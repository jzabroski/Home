# How to Register a .NET assembly for COM Interop
## Via Visual Studio
Note: this approach will only work on the machine where Visual Studio is installed.  It is fine for development, but see the approach for below for deployment to production machines.

1. Right-click a library (dll) project in **Solution Explorer**, click **Properties**
2. Go to the Build tab, click **Register for COM Interop**.

## Via Command Line (Better Way)
Note: If your csproj targets .NET Framework 2.0, you need to use the .NET Framework 2.0 regasm.exe tool.  Below is a table of the different regasm tools and their paths:

| .NET Framework Version | Processor Architecture | RegAsm.exe Location |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 2.0                    | x86                    | C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\RegAsm.exe |
| 2.0                    | x64                    | C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\RegAsm.exe |
| 4.0                    | x86                    | C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe |
| 4.0                    | x64                    | C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe |

1. Run the following command
    ```powershell
    RegAsm.exe /codebase "C:\Program Files\Default Company Name\YourAddin.dll"
    ```

# How to Use a COM Registered .NET Assembly in Excel
## Via VBA
1. Open the Excel spreadsheet
2. Go to the **View** menu in the Ribbon.
3. Click the **Macros** button under the View Ribbon.
4. Click **View Macros** in the context menu.
5. In the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications window, click **Tools** menu, click **References...*
6. In the **References - VBA Project** window, click **Browse...**.
7. Select the tlb (Type Library) file located side-by-side with your .NET Assembly

The dependency will now show up via the dll name (e.g. _YourAddin_).

> 1) [...] Use the Guid attribute and generate a GUID using Generate GUID from Visual Studio Tools menu.  This makes debugging and troubleshooting any issues that come up easier as omitting this causes Visual Studio to generate new guids as you work with your project.  This makes it easier to search the registry for your automation add-in since it will always be listed under the GUID you specify.

Note: You can also just declare a Public Function like so:

```vba
Public Function Test(ByVal A as Integer) As Integer
    Dim realTimeDataServer As YourAddIn.ClassName
    realTimeDataServer = New YourAddIn.ClassName
    Test = realTimeDataServer.test(a)
End Function
```

# Excel Add-ins (In General)

There are 5 ways let VBA call C# code:
1. with COM Interop
    > Introduced in Excel 2000.
    > When you are working with COM Interop you need to define an interface and a class.
    > Both the interface and the class need to have additional attributes added to them.
    > Once the C# dll has been built it needs to be added to the registry using the RegAsm tool.
2. with COM Add-ins
    > Introduced in Excel 2000.
    > COM Add-ins must implement the Extensibility.IDTExtensibility2 interface.
    > If you want an add-in to appear in the COM Add-ins dialogs then it must implement this interface.
    > Once the C# dll has been built it needs to be added to the registry using the RegAsm tool.
    > In addition to the normal COM Interop registration the dll must also be registered with Microsoft Office.
    > This requires adding another registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
3. with Automation Add-ins
    > Introduced in Excel 2002.
    > Automation add-ins must implement the System.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedType.IDispatch interface.
    > Automation add-ins are loaded by the mscoree.dll.
    > The IDispatch interface is derived from the basic IUnknown COM interface.
    > Once the C# dll has been built it needs to be added to the registry using the RegAsm tool.
    > In addition to the normal COM Interop registration an additional registry entry is needed to register the functions.
    > This requires adding two additional class methods with the corresponding ComRegisterFunction attributes.
    > Excel will only recognise a COM Add-in as an Automation Add-in when the "Programmable" subkey is in the registry.
4. with VSTO Add-ins
    > Introduced in Excel 2007.
    > VSTO Add-ins must implement the IStartup interface.
5. Register for COM Interop
    > Allows your managed .NET assembly to be accessible from an unmanaged COM library
    > This option will cause Visual Studio to automatically register your assembly as a COM component in the windows registry when the project is compiled.
    > Registering for COM Interop requires administrator permissions.
    > You must be running Visual Studio as an administrator
    >
    > If you don't check this option you can still generate a COM wrapper by using tlbexe.exe and register your library manually by using regasm.exe
    > You must also configure the Setup project to register the assembly for COM Interop when it is installed.
    > In the properties window for the primary output make sure that Register is set to vsdrpCOM.

    2. COM add-in
    3. Automation add-in (see: http://www.cpearson.com/excel/automationaddins.aspx for more information; it was introduced in Excel XP (2002))
