- If you have a neck adjustment and your hand pain goes away, it's probably not carpal tunnel.

- We can use ultrasound to measure the size of the median nerve, and if it's larger than 10mm, and you have symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel, it's about as effective a diagnosis as electromyography.

- There are three ways to do a carpal tunnel surgery. Microinvasive is the latest and newest and people can return to work in 4 days

# Dupuytren's Contracture and Xiaflex

Dupuytren’s contracture is a condition in which the connective tissue under the skin in your palms and fingers thickens and tightens. Over time, cords of connective tissue can develop that pull your finger in toward your palm and prevent you from straightening it. Xiaflex is approved to treat Dupuytren’s contracture where a cord can be felt.
