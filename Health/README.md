# Water Induced Thermogenesis

[Water-Induced Thermogenesis](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/88/12/6015/2661518)
* The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Volume 88, Issue 12, 1 December 2003, Pages 6015–6019, https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2003-030780

> About 40% of the thermogenic effect originated from warming the water from 22 to 37 C. In men, lipids mainly fueled the increase in metabolic rate. In contrast, in women carbohydrates were mainly used as the energy source. The increase in energy expenditure with water was diminished with systemic β-adrenoreceptor blockade. Thus, drinking 2 liters of water per day would augment energy expenditure by approximately 400 kJ.

> Recent studies have shown that water drinking provided a sympathetic stimulus which increased the metabolic rate, i.e, thermogenesis, which in turn augmented the daily energy expenditure [2]. Hence, this study was designed to check whether this water induced thermogenesis translated into actual weight loss.
