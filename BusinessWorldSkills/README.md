# Effective Decision Making

## Tim Ferriss's Approach to Decision Making

Step 1:  Figure out how to make less of them.

You've only got so much to give.  

Be it physically or mentally, in the end, we all have our limits.

As we try to push ourselves toward maximum output, we end up experiencing an adverse effect.

In an effort to do more, we accomplish less.

According to Ferris, we need to find our **"MED"** or **"Minimum Effective Dose."**

Put simply, it's the minimum amount of effort required to achieve our desired result.

In any situation, there comes a point of diminishing returns.

A point where the effort is > the reward.

So how do we do it?

Like me, Ferris seems to be a big fan of checklists (and rules).

I like to think of it as "Situational Q&A."

If "A" happens, I'm going to do "B."

Or as Tim puts it, **"if this -> then that."**

By creating pre-set rules that govern our lives we drastically reduce the number of decisions that need to be made on a daily basis.

Naturally, when we give ourselves fewer choices, our mental bandwidth increases.

To be clear, the goal is not to make zero decisions.

The goal is to save your mental capacity for the decisions that really matter & standardize the rest.

Think Steve Jobs, black turtleneck.

Every. Day.

Simple, but effective.

One less choice to make.

Why is this so important?

The mind is a muscle.

On one hand, it must be exercised in order to grow.

On the other hand, recovery is also required for any muscle to function at peak levels when called upon.

Your brain is no different.

If your mind is constantly busy making irrelevant decisions, it will fail when you need it most.

What does failure look like?

Ferris describes failure as creating a lack of mental energy resulting in one of two paths:

1. We take shortcuts & act impulsively.

2. We do nothing.

Take the example of diet:

Ferris argues that planning out your meals in advance does more than you may think.

Not only does it allow you to make healthier choices, it also decreases the mental effort needed to say "no" when confronted with alternative options.

As for path #2...

Doing nothing (AKA procrastinating) obviously requires little to no energy in the current moment.

The problem is, by doing nothing, we're simply kicking the proverbial can down the road.

Putting off until tomorrow, what could be done today.

To summarize:

The goal is to limit the decisions we're making to those that truly require in-depth thought while standardizing the rest.

* Create a routine
* Map out your day
* Build your own set of rules

These are forcing functions for limiting choices & increasing output.

## 1. Decision fatigue:

Decision-making is a mentally demanding task.

And the quality of your decisions drops as you get more tired.

Don't make decisions when you're tired.

## 2. Survivorship bias:

We're all wowed by the rockstar CEO that dropped out of college.

But we overlook the 99% of dropouts who go on to fail.

Our brains get distracted by shiny exceptions.

Don't fall for exceptions when making a decision.

## 3. Social proof and groupthink:

We have a tendency to blindly copy our friends and colleagues.

But sometimes copying others has disastrous effects ― like smoking to fit in with your group.

Think twice before you start imitating those near you.

## 4. Confirmation bias:

We demand extraordinarily high evidence for views that do not fit our existing beliefs.

And accept extraordinarily low evidence for views that do.

Evaluate both pros and cons before making a decision.

## 5. Pay attention to new information:

Our brains are quick to form strong first impressions.

This means that our brains often underestimate the importance of new information.

Stupidity often comes from overlooking crucial new information.

Pay attention to it.

## 6. Sunk cost bias:

Just because you've spent time or money doing something doesn't mean you should keep doing it.

Gamblers will spend good money after bad.

People will spend years in unhappy relationships.

Learn to separate the past from the present when deciding.

## 7. Don't make decisions when you're emotional:

We've all made decisions in the moment that we regret later.

Why? Because we let our emotions get the best of us in the moment.

Be patient and wait to make decisions when  you're in a calm emotional state.

## 8. Leadership bias:

We often do things because someone in charge tells us to do it ― teachers, parents, bosses.

But sometimes this can have disastrous effects ― like leaders pushing their countries into unjustified wars.

Learn to think for yourself.

## 9. Dunning–Kruger Effect:

When we don't have the required skill, our brains compensate with overconfidence.

Think of all the people who buy crypto without knowing anything about it.

Psychologists call this the Dunning–Kruger Effect.

Don't let your confidence trick you.

## 10. Liking bias:

Often times we can fool ourselves into making a decision because we like the person in front of us.

That's why ads always feature attractive people - they know you like attractive people.

Don't do something just because you like the person asking you to do it.
