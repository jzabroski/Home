> Among the known indexing methods, bitmap indexes are
particularly well suited for answering such queries on large scientific data. Therefore, more details are
given on the state of the art of bitmap indexing techniques. This chapter also briefly touches on some
emerging data analysis systems that donâ€™t yet make use of indexes. We present some evidence that these
systems could also benefit from the use of indexes.

> As examples of the use of the interface and the performance of PAM, we apply the library to four applications: simple range sums, interval trees, 2D range trees, and ranked word index searching. The interface greatly simplifies the implementation of these data structures over direct implementations. Sequentially the code achieves performance that matches or exceeds existing libraries designed specially for a single application, and in parallel our implementation gets speedups ranging from 40 to 90 on 72 cores with 2-way hyperthreading.
